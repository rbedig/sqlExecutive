# sqlExecutive
I developed this compact alternative to phpMyAdmin for those of us who are SQL literate and find the interface of that package, er, obtuse, to put it nicely... It is just a simple query tool built with PHP and Ajax, but the interface is slick and robust. It works with Microsoft SQL Server as well.
